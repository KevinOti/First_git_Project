The Journey to becoming a Data analyst

Learning and self learning is the most beautiful thing, you get to engage the mind and later share with the would what you have been learning, 
this either through the scripts of codes from the exercises or even full project done from scratch.

The snippet of codes shared is from Mysql self learning journey.

The key concepts from the exercises include
        
        Retrieving data from a database using the select clause statements and the same filtered based on other clauses 
        such as (Where, Limit and groupby)
        
        Joining tables using the powerful join statements(inner or outer joins) with alias taken into account especially in 
        situation where only limited columns needs to be returned
        
        Manipulating tables - the core strategy here is having CRUD in mind and will single handedly ensure most concepts are 
        mastered and implemented
        
        Summarizing data - use of aggregation functions to better understand the data
        
        Complex queries  and Mysql methodologies (creating views, stored procedures, events and transactions)
        
 This sets the journey for more learning and implementation processes such as designing and developing a database and applying the mentioned concepts to
 even query the database
